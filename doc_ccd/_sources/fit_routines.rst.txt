Fit Routines
============

Three fit routines are provided with specialised input/output configurations:

* Fiting of separate sepctra (1D) :doc:`programs/ccd_single`
* Fitting of time-regularized spectra (2D) :doc:`programs/ccd_time`

Each fit routine can use one of the following kernels (i.e., models) to
describe the SIP spectra:

* Resistivity Cole-Cole decomposition
* Conductivity Cole-Cole decomposition
