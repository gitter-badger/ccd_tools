Installation
============

This section covers the installation of the Debye decomposition tools, which
include all files neccessary to conduct decompositions of SIP spectr.a  For the
separate installation of *geccoinv* and *dd_interfaces*, please refer to the
`README_*` files in the corresponding directories. This is usually only required
for an developing environment.

.. note::

    Installation tests were only conducted on 64-bit machines. Correspondingly,
    the following instructions refer to the 64-bit versions of all software
    packages.  However, we are not aware of any inherent limitations that could
    prevent the Debye tools to run on 32-bit  processors, as long as the
    software stack (Python, numpy, matplotlib, Latex) is running on these
    machines.  If you are having problems using the Debye tools on a 32-bit
    system, feel free to open a bug report and we will try to help.
